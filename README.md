# Kaggle-Projects
Some work I've done on Kaggle Projects

Todo:
1. Create a pyproject.toml for the Modules folder and generate a wheel (current installation method is deprecated, and will be enforced in the future)
2. Implement visualizer using vispy as first choice, and plt as second choice
3. Create method for changing date-index on dataframes
